# CollapsibleView
A view which can collapse similar to the predictive text area of the iOS keyboard. The CollapsibleView is created by animating the height constraints of the view and utilizing swipe gesture recognizers. The view could have any type of control placed inside. In the sample project the view is positioned below the navigation bar and contains a textfield.
